## Overview

Exulu Frontend is a powerful, open-source web interface for managing AI agents, workflows, and knowledge contexts. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it provides an intuitive experience for interacting with the Exulu IMP (Intelligence Management Platform) backend.

Think of it as your command center for AI orchestration - where you design agents, manage their knowledge sources, monitor performance, and orchestrate complex workflows.

### Why Open Source?

We believe that developer tools should be transparent, customizable, and community-driven. The Exulu Frontend is open source to enable:

- **Customization**: Adapt the interface to your specific needs
